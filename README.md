# Arduino-Based Heart Rate and Stress Monitoring System

This was a group project developed as part of the Tinkering Lab course at IIT Ropar (April 2025).

## ðŸ”§ Components Used
- ESP32
- Pulse Amped Sensor
- GSR Sensor (Galvanic Skin Response)
- OLED Display
- Breadboard & connecting wires

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Real-time heart rate (BPM) monitoring using Pulse Sensor
- Stress level indication based on GSR sensor values
- OLED display for live data visualization
- Simulated and tested using Tinkercad and Arduino IDE

## ðŸ’» Code
The code is available in `heart_monitor.ino`.

## ðŸ§ª Note
This was a learning project focused on hardware interfacing and signal reading.
